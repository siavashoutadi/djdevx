# djdevx Code Standards and Best Practices

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.10+** - Core language
- **Typer** - CLI framework for command-line interfaces
- **Jinja2** - Template engine for code generation
- **pytest** - Testing framework
- **Rich** - Console output with styling (PrintConsole wrapper)
- **uv** - Python package manager and runner


## Best Practices for coding

✓ Always use type hints
✓ Always use uv for running scripts and managing dependencies
✓ Follow Python PEP 8 standards
✓ Use descriptive naming - let code explain itself
✓ Only comment complex logic (not one-line comments)
✓ Add docstrings for classes and functions
✓ Always use PrintConsole for output
✓ Group imports logically
✓ Use Typer for CLI commands
✓ Use Jinja2 for templates (.j2 extension)
✓ Handle errors with meaningful messages
